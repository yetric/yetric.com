<p class="lead">Building and growing your online products is all about knowing your numbers and data and working on stuff that matters. How do you <strong>acquire valuable leads</strong> to your product? How do you make sure that you have taught them all they need to know about your product when <strong>onboarding new users</strong>? How do you <strong>keep your customers engaged</strong> in your product and how do you <strong>retain customers</strong> that for some reason have stopped using your product.</p>
<p>Yetric helps you and your team become data-driven and more iterative (faster, smaller and more iterations) in your efforts in order to be able to know where to put down your efforts and get most bang-for-the-buck. For us growth is the main thing, and we think you grow your business by knowing what your user wants and what turns them off.</p>

<p>Psst, we have a blog btw: <a href="https://yetric.net" target="_blank">Yetric Blog at Yetric.net</a></p>

<h2 id="user-experience">We Focus on <span>User Experience</span></h2>

<p>Knowing what your users love about your product and where they have problems using it can make a big difference in how you build and maintain your product online. By focusing on the User Experience and what value you add to your users you can make prioritization of features and resources easier and put the money to work where they have the best potential of making a good ROI. It is crucial that you set up the correct metrics and KPI:s for measuring the actual user experience within your product in order to be able to validate your efforts and prioritize upcoming work and features.</p>
<p>At Yetric Metrics we believe that using data, analysis and insights together with the mindset that the product exists in order to create the best possible value for the user is the best combination to create awesome products that will grow in both user numbers and revenue. As a product owner it is important to learn how the user use the actual product and act accordingly on that data.</p>

<h2 id="acqusition">We Improve <span>Acquisition</span></h2>

You do not want to pay expensive ad fees without knowing how efficient your acquisition channel is. We take care of that for you, so you can focus on making your business even better for your customers.</p>
    <p>Which acqusition channel is the most efficient one and which one do you need to tune because it has not lived up to its full potential as a channel for generationg new leads and customers? Segmenting new users is key to actually know what works and what do not when it comes to acquisition. We can help you setting up a segmented acqusition funnel and kick-ass analysis on top that funnel.</p>
    <p>A lot of existing products have unlocked potential when it comes to generate new streams and funnels of acquisition without paying a lot for expensive ads on Facebook and Google, maybe you need help to unlock these new acquisition streams?</p>

<h2 id="onboarding">We Like to Tweak <span>Onboarding</span></h2>
<p>One of the most daunting tasks of any product is to show the customer what it has to offer before he/she gets bored and leave. Yetric enables a better plan and tools for onboarding your valuable leads. It doesn't matter how cool feature you have if you can't teach your users how to use them and where to find them.</p>
    <p>Sometimes it is tempting to offer a lot of different options for your users, if you are offering one thing and start to get traction on that, why not add something new and get even better results? Maybe that is not a good idea, keeping the offer simple and efficient to the customer is key to a good onboarding process for new users. </p>

<h2 id="engagement">We Measure <span>Engagement</span></h2>
<p>Ok, you have created a ton of cool features for your product. Which one is just for show and which one does actually drive engagement and earnings. By knowing what features drives most engagement you will have knowledge about your product, making it easier to focus and prioritize your ongoing efforts tuning your products into efficient money machines.</p>
<p>Increasing engagement increases revenue and is a good measure on that your product is providing some sort of value for your users. By measuring the effects of your changes and doing proper testing of bigger changes before rolling them out to all your users, you can tune your engagement step by step, in a data-driven, iterative process where you learn by numbers what work, what does not work and most important, you put your effort where it is needed.</p>
    <p>By using tools such as A/B-testing, Multivariate Testing, Conversion Optimization and proper user segmentation based on your audience we can help you increasing engagement on your most important use-cases. Instead of big redesigns you can incrementally increase the user engagement with a more data-driven mindset in your product development lifecycle, a very cost-efficient way to do product and business development. Lower the risks and increase the revenue by small steps, tuning your product when it comes to income and user experience.</p>

<h2 id="retention">We Help Increase <span>Retention</span></h2>
<p>A lot of companies only focus on acquisition, which can be quite expensive, new customers cost more than retaining already existing ones that have stopped using your products. We offer you the tools that helps you engage and retain your churned customers.</p>
    <p>By using tools such as Push Notifications, automated email campaigns, remarketing and custom audiences on social network you can re-engage customers who once was engaged customers but for some reason have churned out from using your product. We can help you setting up re-engaging campaigns and automated tools for getting your users back to using your product and increase revenues in a very cost-efficient way.</p>
